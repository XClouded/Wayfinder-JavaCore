This package contains functionality for saving favorites and synchronize them 
with the WF server through the Java Core. 

<h1>The Wayfinder Favorites</h1>

A favorite represent a place found during application usage that the user wants
to remember. 
<br/>
Because favorites are stored in the server and are user dependent, those can be 
recover after reinstallation of the application, and can be accessed from 
different clients (web, application)   
<br/>   
The {@link com.wayfinder.core.favorite.FavoriteInterface} is the central access point and is obtained directly from 
Core. 

<h2>Favorite Initialization</h2>
In order to avoid necessity of server synchronization and to provide fast 
restoring at application start all favorites are keep in local persistence,
those will be loaded automatically on first access 
(first call of any method from FavoriteInterface).
<br/> 
Use asynchronous preload method to control the loading time of favorites.

<h4>Example of preloading</h4>
<pre>
    ...
    ModuleData moduleData = new ModuleData(pal, serverData, new J2SECallBack());
    Core core = CoreFactory.createFullCore(moduleData);
    FavoriteInterface favIfc = core.getFavoriteInterface();
    favIfac.preload(new FavoriteLoadListener() {
        
    public void error(RequestID requestID, CoreError error) {
        //an error has occurred the favorite could not be restored locally
        //this could be a permission problem or corrupted data
        //we can force a server synchronization to recover the data form server
        //but the local changes (not sent to the server yet) if any would be 
        //lost so user should be notify.    
    }
        
    public void loaded(RequestID id, int numberOfFavorites) {
        //loaded with success now we can display a fully initialized list of 
        //favorites         
    }
</pre>   


<h2>Favorites Access and Sorting</h2>
Reading is done through a {@link com.wayfinder.core.favorite.ListModel} that will be automatically
updated when the favorite are added or removed because of user manual operation,
automatic restoring from persistence or synchronization with the server.
The favorite list will be automatically sorted alphabetically by name.
<br/>
Is desired that ListModel is used directly by the List GUI component by letting 
the GUI component to request the data instead of pushing that manually.   
Note that the core ListModel is not related with favorites and could be use in the 
future for other list that are changing. 

<h4>Example using swing framework</h4>
<pre>

public void initUI(Core core){
    //.... other ui code 
    FavoriteInterface favIfc = core.getFavoriteInterface();
    ListModel favListModel = favIfc.getFavoriteListModel(); 
    JList favList = new JList(new DelegateListModel(listModel));
    //.... other ui code 
}

/**
 * javax.swing.ListModel that delegate all method call to a 
 * core ListModel.     
 **/ 
class DelegateListModel extends javax.swing.AbstractListModel 
        implements ListDataListener {
    
    ListModel favoriteListModel;
    
    public DelegateListModel(ListModel favoriteListModel) {
        this.favoriteListModel = favoriteListModel;
    }

    //@Override
    public Object getElementAt(int index) {
        //we only want to display the name of the favorite
        return ((Favorite)favoriteListModel.getElementAt(index)).getName();
    }

    //@Override
    public int getSize() {
        return favoriteListModel.getSize();
    }

    //@Override
    public void contentsChanged(int start, int end) {
        this.fireContentsChanged(favoriteListModel, start, end);
    }

    //@Override
    public void intervalAdded(int start, int end) {
        this.fireIntervalAdded(favoriteListModel, start, end);
    }

    //@Override
    public void intervalRemoved(int start, int end) {
        this.fireIntervalRemoved(favoriteListModel, start, end);
    }

    //@Override
    public void addListDataListener(javax.swing.event.ListDataListener l) {
        super.addListDataListener(l);
        favoriteListModel.addListDataListener(this);
    }

    //@Override
    public void removeListDataListener(javax.swing.event.ListDataListener l) {
        super.removeListDataListener(l);
        if (listenerList.getListenerCount() == 0) {
            favoriteListModel.removeListDataListener(this);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
   
<h2>Favorites user operation Add/Remove/Replace</h2>
A new favorite can be created only through FavoriteInterface add method.
A favorite cannot be changed, use the replace method instead. 
<br/>
All user operation (add/remove/replace) are synchronous in the sense that 
changes are visible immediately in the associated ListModel. 
The persistence operations are done silently in the background.    
<p>
A global listener of type can be registered to be notified about errors
during writing of favorite list changes (add/remove/replace). 
The only possible action will be to do a synchronization in order to loose the 
changes when restarting.  
</p>   

<h2>Favorites Server Synchronization</h2>
Favorites can be synchronize with the server, and is advisable to do it from 
time to time (e.g. at each application startup). 
Note that the API will not do any unrequested/automatic synchronization. 
<br/>
Server synchronization is a asynchronous operation, the success or
failure is notified through {@link com.wayfinder.core.favorite.FavoriteSynchListener}
<p>
There are two concerns regarding server synchronization:
<ul>
<li>
After synchronization all new added favorites that were sent to the server 
will be replaced with favorites received from server. Those favorites are 
identical as content but are different instances and old Favorite instance 
cannot be used anymore in user operation (remove/replace).
</li>
<li>
If there is an error after the server has process the synch request but 
before the client receive the full response, the new added favorite will be 
doubled at next synchronization request.
</li>
</ul> 
User operation are allowed during server synchronization but the
removing or replace for some Favorites can be denied see above why.
</p>
<h2>Threading safety considerations</h2>
The FavoriteInterface should be called only from UI/Main Thread. 
Failure to do so can lead to unexpected random behavior.
<br/>
All listeners calls will be done through UI/Main Thread via CallbackHandler.
