Contains functionality for geocoding

<h2>Geocoding</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The art of geocoding involves taking geographic data (addresses, street names,
zip codes etc) and translating this into a set of coordinates (latitude,
longitude).
<p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Currently there are no methods in this API for geocoding. To realize this, it's
easier to use the methods through the search API to first search for a location
and then take the position attached to the search hit.

<h2>Reverse geocoding</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Reverse geocoding is basically the exact opposite of geocoding, eg taking a 
position and translating this into geographic data - a name representing this 
position. This name is usually an address, a name of the place or something 
similar.
<p>
By using reverse geocoding in a client, an application can easily display
information about any point in the map.
<p>
The response of the geocoding reply will also contain the TopRegion ID of the
country or state the position is located in. By reverse geocoding the user's
current position it can be used to identify the country the user is currently
in.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Using this api is fairly straight forward:
<ol>
<li>Extract a position from another API or create one using coordinates</li>
<li>Have a receiver class implement the GeocodeListener interface</li>
<li>Grab the GeocodeInterface from the main Core class</li>
<li>Call GeocodeInterface.reverseGeocode(Position, GeocodeListener)</li>
<li>When done, the receiver class will be sent an AddressInfo object containing
information about the position.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example code</h3>

(The class containing this code will implement the GeocodeListener interface)

<pre>
    private RequestID m_reqID;
    
    public void reverseGeocode(Core c) {
        // we need a position, here's one in Lund, Sweden
        Position p = new Position(664744320, 157372032);
        
        GeocodeInterface geoIfc = c.getGeocodeInterface();
        // send request and remember the request ID
        m_reqID = geoIfc.reverseGeocode(p, this);
    }
    
    @Override  // method in the GeocodeListener interface
    public void reverseGeocodeDone(RequestID requestID, AddressInfo adressInfo) {
        // first check request id to ensure that the id matches, otherwise
        // it could be an earlier, stale, reply
        if(requestID.equals(m_reqID)) {
            // response :D
            System.out.print("Position is located in the city of: " + adressInfo.getCity());
        }
    }
</pre>
