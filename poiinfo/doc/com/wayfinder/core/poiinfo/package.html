This package contains functionality for retrieving extra information on a POI 
through the Java Core.

<h1>POI info module</h1>

<h3>POIs</h3>

<p>
Points of Interest (POIs) can be seen as landmarks. They're visible in the map,
and can come up as results from a search. Only basic information is available 
initially (usually the name and sometimes a short description). Other available
info can be obtained through a request to the POI info module. <br/>
You have to provide an ID string to identify the POI for which you request the
data.
</p>

<h4>Search results as POIs</h4>
<p>
Any search result has an ID string associated. Since at first only basic info
is sent in the search reply, this ID can be used to identify the search result
and the extra information from our servers. <b>Beware that these IDs are not
persistent.</b> However, they can be used for some time after the search was
made, but <b>there's no point in storing them for later use</b>.
</p>

<h4>Map positions as POIs</h4>
<p>
Any map point can be identified through an ID string consisting of its MC2 
coordinates and some other parameters. This string can be obtained from the
map component.
</p>

<h3>POI info request</h3>

<p>
The POI info interface provides only one method, to initiate a POI info request.
You need to supply the ID string and a listener (a class implementing the
PoiInfoListener interface) that will get either the result of the request or 
an error message.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre>
public class InfoHandler implements PoiInfoListener {
    
    // Core reference
    Core m_core;
    
    // useful to keep track of requests
    RequestID m_reqID;
    
    // ...
    
    public void getInfo(String id) {
        m_reqID = m_core.getPoiInfoInterface().requestInfo(id, this);
    }
    
    // called from the POI info module when the request is successful
    public void requestInfoDone(RequestID reqID, PoiInfo info) {
        // do whatever you want with the info
        System.out.println(info.toString());
    }
    
    // called from the POI info module when there's an error 
    public void error(RequestID reqID, CoreError err) {
        // handle the error
        System.out.println(err.getInternalMsg());
    }
}
</pre>
