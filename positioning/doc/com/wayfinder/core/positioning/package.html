Functionality for obtaining positions through different methods such as GPS,
CellID and similar

<h1>Positioning</h1>
This API is fairly central to the Wayfinder Core API since it's responsible for
grabbing positions for use by the rest of the APIs.


<h2>Different types of positioning</h2>
<h3>Cell ID</h3>
This positioning type uses information from the wireless radio masts in the
vicinity of the device to give a rather rough position. The information from the
masts are sent to a server which in turn looks up the location of the mast in a
database.
<p>
The accuracy of positions grabbed using Cell ID can be quite bad and
range from a few hundred meters in cities up to a few kilometers in rural zones.

<h3>GPS positions</h3>
Global Position System (GPS) uses an array of 24 to 32 satellites circling the 
earth to determine the location of a specific point in the world. This is done
using a combination of time stamps and orbital information.
<p>
GPS positions usually have a very high accuracy, often down to a few meters.
However in locations without clear view of the sky or in extreme weather these
positions can become inaccurate.


<h2>Using the positioning system.</h2>

<h3>Registering listeners and receiving positions</h3>
The first thing to do is to have a class implement the LocationListener
interface. Once the interface has been registered as a listener, the method 
locationUpdated(LocationInformation, LocationProvider) will then be called when 
a new position is available.
<p>
There are two ways to register a listener for receiving positions, asynchronous
and synchronous. Please note that the name refers to the method used by the
<u>internal positioning thread</u> to update the listener.
<p>
Synchronous callbacks are recommended for background systems that don't need
to update the UI directly. Asynchronous can be used with favor when the
callback also needs to update the UI.
<h4>Asynchronous callbacks</h4>
To (de)register a listener, use the methods:
<ul>
<li>addLocationListener(Criteria, LocationListener)</li>
<li>removeLocationListener(LocationListener)</li>
</ul>
Updates to the listener will be done using the previously registered
CallbackHandler, eg through the thread previously assigned the job to service
callbacks. <i>Note that positions are called every second and if the callback
handler is otherwise heavily taxed can quickly flood the dispatcher system</i>

<h4>Synchronous callbacks</h4>
To (de)register a listener, use the methods:
<ul>
<li>addSyncLocationListener(Criteria, LocationListener)</li>
<li>removeSyncLocationListener(LocationListener)</li>
</ul>
Updates to the listener will be done using the same thread that services the
positions received from the PAL. Note that while this can be more efficient,
heavy operations in the locationUpdated() method can cause the positions to
lag.

<h3>Provider state</h3>
In addition to sending position updates, the API also offers a system to
receive updates about the state of the provider. Please note that the provider
and it's state will be supplied in the calls to LocationListener.locationUpdated()
but if there is a need to only listen for the states, this API can be used.
<p>
To use it, have a class implement the ProviderStateListener interface and
use the following methods:
<ul>
<li>addProviderStateListener(ProviderStateListener)</li>
<li>removeProviderStateListener(ProviderStateListener)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pausing and resuming the system</h3>
The positioning system can be paused and resumed by using the following
methods:
<ul>
<li>pause()</li>
<li>resume()</li>
</ul>
Please note that due to inner threads, there are no guarantees on exactly when 
the system will pause/resume. Please note that pausing the system will also
cause the Core to disable the actual GPS handling through the PAL.
