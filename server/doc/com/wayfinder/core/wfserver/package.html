<body>
<p>This package contains functionality very related to the Wayfinder server itself. 
</p>

<h1>Tunneling data through the server</h1>
<p> See  {@link com.wayfinder.core.wfserver.WFServerInterface#tunnel(com.wayfinder.core.wfserver.tunnel.TunnelRequest, com.wayfinder.core.wfserver.tunnel.TunnelResponseListener listener)}

<h1>Client upgrade availability check</h1> 
<p>The client can check the server if there is a new version available</p>
<p>The actual upgrade process is handle by the client (actually by the platform itself).</p>

<h2>Use scenarios</h2>
<p>Usually the platform will provide automatic checking and upgrade to a new version but the are some cases that are not covered by that:</p>
<li>Give possibility to check if the current version is not obsoleted (still work against the server) in that case the client can do a force update</li>
<li>Update the clients that are embedded for those the platform cannot provide automatic checking</li>
<li>Delay release provide a stub application to be embedded with the core that will do check and force update on first start</li>

<h2>Usage and example code</h2>
<p>In order to work in all cases this should be the first call that the client dose after creating the core. 
The request is guarantee to work without any user activation.</p>
<pre>
    //Example code for client upgrade 
    ...
    ModuleData moduleData = new ModuleData(pal, serverData, new J2SECallBack());
    Core core = CoreFactory.createFullCore(moduleData);
    WFServerInterface serverIfc = core.getWfServerInterface();
    serverIfc.clientUpgradeCheck(new UpgradeCheckListener() {
    
        @Override
        public void error(RequestID requestID, CoreError error) {
            //an error has occurred the request couldn't be finish
            //this can be a network problem or a server error.
        }
        
        public void loaded(RequestID id, int numberOfFavorites) {
            //loaded with success now we can display a fully initialized list of 
            //favorites         
        }
        
        @Override
        public void clientNotFound(RequestID reqId) {
            //no client could be found check with server/service delivery, 
            //this could also be a wrong configuration
        }

        @Override
        public void clientUpToDate(RequestID reqId) {
            //client was found but is up to date 
            //this will happen most of the time
        }

        @Override
        public void clientUpgrade(RequestID reqId, ClientUpgradeInfo upgradeInfo) {
            //new version for the client is available
            String newVersion = upgradeInfo.getLatestVersion();
            
            //the uri that point to the update, the content of that depend 
            //on each the platform 
            //e.g. Android market://details?id=com.vodafone.android.navigation 
            String updateUri = upgradeInfo.getUpgradeUri();
            if (upgradeInfo.isForceUpgrade()) {
                //show a confirmation dialog for updating
                //use the updateUri to update the application if user accept                
                //close the application if the user refuse  
            } else {
                //show a confirmation dialog for updating
                //use the updateUri to update the application if user accept                
                //let the user continue using the application if user refuse
            }
        } 
     });
</pre>

<h2>Current restrains</h2>
<p>As the checking is base on {@link ServerData#getClientType()} and {@link ServerData#getVersionNumber()} only. 
Be careful to use different client type for each application and for each "flavor" of the application that require separate updates.
For Android this means each package name should have his own client type.</p>
<p>Each new version of the application should work an all devices that have the previous version. The checking doesn't depend on device features, API version... which can be used in Android Market to filter incompatible devices</p>
